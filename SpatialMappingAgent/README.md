## Result of Main Scene (Spatial Mapping)
The agent is spawn with air-tap after it has meshed the environment. You need to wait for the mesh to generate before tapping. There is a bug here though. The agent is technically created when the scene plays and goes into free fall LOL...

Without mesh visualization

## Result of AgentPlatformClick Scene (no spatial mapping)
Agent is spawn in the platform after a air-tap gesture. You can make it walk anywhere using the air-tap gesture and gaze. 
This is implemented using NavMesh Components.
